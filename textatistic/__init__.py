Textatistic is a simple program, written in Python, to calculate common readability indices and text characteristics. Basic usage:

    >>> from textatistics import Textatistics
    >>> s = TextStatistic('There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.')
